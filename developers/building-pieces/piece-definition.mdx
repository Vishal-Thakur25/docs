This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a Gelato addon with an action that fetches random icecream flavor and trigger that fetches new icecream flavor created. It assumes that you are familiar with the following:

- [NRAI Local development](../development-setup/local) Or [GitHub Codespaces](../development-setup/codespaces).
- TypeScript syntax.

## Addon Definition

To get started, let's generate a new addon for Gelato

```bash
npm run cli addons create
```

You will be asked three questions to define your new addon:

1. `Addon Name`: Specify a name for your addon. This name uniquely identifies your addon within the NRAI ecosystem.
2. `Package Name`: Optionally, you can enter a name for the npm package associated with your addon. If left blank, the default name will be used.
3. `Addon Type`: Choose the addon type based on your intention. It can be either "custom" if it's a tailored solution for your needs, or "community" if it's designed to be shared and used by the broader community.

**Example:**

```bash
npm run cli addons create

? Enter the addon name: gelato
? Enter the package name: @NRAI/addon-gelato
? Select the addon type: community
```

The addon will be generated at `packages/addons/community/gelato/`,
the `src/index.ts` file should contain the following code

```ts
import { AddonAuth, createAddon } from '@NRAI/addons-framework';

export const gelato = createAddon({
  displayName: 'Gelato',
  logoUrl: 'https://cdn.NRAI.com/addons/gelato.png',
  auth: AddonAuth.None(),
  authors: [],
  actions: [],
  triggers: [],
});
```
