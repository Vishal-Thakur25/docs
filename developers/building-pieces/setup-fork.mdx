To start building addons, we need to fork the repository that contains the framework library and the development environment. Later, we will publish these addons as `npm` artifacts.

Follow these steps to fork the repository:

1. Go to the repository page at https://github.com/NRAI/NRAI.
2. Click the `Fork` button located in the top right corner of the page.

<Tip>
If you are an enterprise customer and want to use the private addons feature, you can refer to the tutorial on how to set up a [private fork](../misc/private-fork).
