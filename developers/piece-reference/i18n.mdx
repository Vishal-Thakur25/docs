<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate">
    Run the following command to create a translation file with all the strings that need translation in your addon
    ```bash
    npm run cli addons generate-translation-file PIECE_FOLDER_NAME
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Translate">
     Make a copy of `packages/addons/<community_or_custom>/<your_addon>/src/i18n/translation.json`, name it `<locale>.json` i.e fr.json and translate the values.
    <Tip>
      For open source addons, you can use the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/NRAI) to translate to different languages. These translations will automatically sync back to your code.
