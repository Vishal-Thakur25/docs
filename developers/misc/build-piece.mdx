You can use the CLI to build custom addons for the platform. This process compiles the addons and exports them as a `.tgz` packed archive.

### How It Works

The CLI scans the `packages/addons/` directory for the specified addon. It checks the **name** in the `package.json` file. If the addon is found, it builds and packages it into a `.tgz` archive.

### Usage

To build a addon, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the CLI installed by cloning the repository.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
npm run build-addon
```

You will be prompted to enter the name of the addon you want to build. For example:

```bash
? Enter the addon folder name : google-drive
```

The CLI will build the addon and you will be given the path to the archive. For example:

```bash
Addon 'google-drive' built and packed successfully at dist/packages/addons/community/google-drive
```
