You can publish your addons to the npm registry and share them with the community. Users can install your addon from Settings -> My Addons -> Install Addon -> type in the name of your addon package.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login to npm">
    Make sure you are logged in to npm. If not, please run:
    ```bash
    npm login
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rename Addon">
    Rename the addon name in `package.json` to something unique or related to your organization's scope (e.g., `@my-org/addon-PIECE_NAME`). You can find it at `packages/addons/PIECE_NAME/package.json`.
    <Tip>
    Don't forget to increase the version number in `package.json` for each new release.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish">
    <Tip>
    Replace `PIECE_FOLDER_NAME` with the name of the folder.
    </Tip>
    Run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run publish-addon PIECE_FOLDER_NAME
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Congratulations! You can now import the addon from the settings page.**
