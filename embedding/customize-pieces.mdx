If you would like to only show specific addons to your embedding users, we recommend you do the following:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Tag Addons">
        Tag the addons you would like to show to your user by going to **Platform Admin -> Setup -> Addons**, selecting the addons you would like to tag and hit **Apply Tags**

        ![Bulk Tag](../resources/screenshots/tag-addons.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add Tags to Provision Token">
       You need to specify the tags of addons in the token, check how to generate token in [provisioning users](./provision-users).

        You should specify the `addons` claim like this:
        ```json
        {
            /// Other claims
            "addonsFilterType": "ALLOWED",
            "addonsTags": [ "free" ]
        }
        ```

        Each time the token is used by the embedding SDK, it will sync all addons with these tags to the token's project. 
        The project will only contain the addons that contain these tags.
    </Step>
</Steps>
