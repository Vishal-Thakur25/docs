Set your AI providers so your users enjoy a seamless building experience with our universal AI addons like [Text AI](https://nrai.io/addons/text-ai).

## Manage AI Providers

You can manage the AI providers that you want to use in your flows. To do this, go to the **AI** page in the **Admin Console**.

You can define the provider's base URL and the API key. 

These settings will be used for all the projects for every request to the AI provider.

## Configure AI Credits Limits Per Project

You can configure the token limits per project. To do this, go to the project general settings and change the **AI Credits** field to the desired value.

<Note>
  This limit is per project and is an accumulation of all the reported usage by the AI addon in the project.
  Since only the AI addon goes through the NRAI API,
  using any other addon like the standalone OpenAI, Anthropic or Perplexity addons will not count towards or respect this limit.
</Note>

### AI Credits Explained

AI credits are the number tasks that can be run by any of our universal AI addons.

So if you have a flow run that contains 5 universal AI addons steps, the AI credits consumed will be 5.
